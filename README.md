# 🚶‍♂️ Fair Pedestrian Detection with YOLOv8

A fairness-aware object detection project addressing **height-based bias** in autonomous vehicle pedestrian detection systems. Built using the [BDD100K](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/) dataset and Ultralytics YOLOv8.

## 📌 Motivation

Recent research shows a 23% higher false-negative rate for pedestrians under 140 cm (e.g., children). This disparity can lead to **real-world safety issues** for shorter individuals. Our goal is to:

- Audit existing detection models for height-based bias.
- Mitigate this bias via data augmentation and fairness-aware training.
